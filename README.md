## 📦 Postman API Testing Practice 2

This repository is a continuation of hands-on API testing and automation practice, extending the work done in the [Rest_Assured-Postman-API-Practice1](https://github.com/AARdacca/Rest_Assured-Postman-API-Practice1) repository.

It focuses on exploring API endpoints, validating functionality, and ensuring robustness through structured Postman collections and Rest Assured automation.

🔍 **Objective:**  
To implement and automate end-to-end API scenarios by inspecting browser network activity and verifying expected behaviors with assertions and edge case handling.
